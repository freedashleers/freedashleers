personal loans generally have fixed interest rates, so your monthly payment is fixed. And unlike credit cards, personal loans provide borrowers with a lump-sum payment—if you need additional money, you’d have to apply for another loan. Some credit cards also offer rewards, which means you can get cash-back, points, or miles on your everyday spending. However, if you’re not diligent about paying off your balance on time and in full every month, the interest you pay on your credit card debt may exceed the value of the rewards you earn.

Generally, credit cards are a better choice if you’re looking to finance everyday expenses, while a personal loan can be a solid option if you want a lump-sum payment for debt consolidation or paying off a major expense. Regardless of whether you opt for a credit card or personal loan, they’re both types of debt, so your credit score can be harmed if you don’t make your payments on time and in full.
