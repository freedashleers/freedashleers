A personal loan is best for people who want flexibility in how they use their funds, prefer a lump-sum payment, and have a strong credit score.

Unlike other types of debt, like an auto loan or mortgage, a personal loan offers versatility: You can use the funds to pay off medical expenses, finance moving costs, purchase a big-ticket item, and more. 

While personal loans typically offer lower APRs than credit cards, borrowers need a solid credit score to qualify. Therefore, they may be a budget-friendly lending option for those who have strong credit scores and histories.
